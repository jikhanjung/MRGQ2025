# Program Notes

## Gioachino Rossini (1792-1868) - Overture to 《La Gazza Ladra》

I just realized while writing this - I don't know the plot of the opera "La Gazza Ladra." But that's fine. After all, only the overture is famous from this opera. (If you're curious about the plot... someone summarized it as 'the French version of Sim Cheong-jeon where a daughter saves her father.') This piece, which the genius Rossini dashed off at the height of his fame at twenty-five, overflows with his characteristic frivolity that isn't frivolous and his tedium that isn't tedious.

Though it would be perfect as an opening piece, it hasn't been frequently performed at Hwahyeon Society concerts until now because it was difficult to express the snare drum tremolo that appears at the beginning. We plan to have our selected performer showcase brilliant tabalet technique to boldly announce the start of this concert.

## Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) - Toccata and Fugue in D minor (BWV 565)

Who doesn't know the dramatic opening that starts with "Ti-ro-ri~"? This is Bach's most famous organ piece, and as widely known as it is, it receives varied evaluations, with some even claiming it's not Bach's work. The estimated composition date also varies, but it's generally understood to be an early work from around 1708-9. The un-Bach-like messiness and somewhat clumsy development might make you wonder "Is this really Bach?" but these are exactly the qualities you can find in Bach's early works, and they're quite charming. Moreover, the rustic melodies of these early works inevitably touch the Korean heart... Oh, among the various evaluations, I wholeheartedly agree with the assessment that "it seems like a virtuosic piece but isn't as difficult as it sounds."

Miryeon performed this piece with the same member composition at the Hwahyeon Society 45th Anniversary OB Concert in 2012. For this concert, more than ten years later, we've introduced an 8-string guitar to enhance the majestic bass and used steel strings on the 1st part to achieve baroque effects.

## Jorge Cardoso (1949-) - Milonga from 《24 Piezas Sudamericanas》

Milonga is a South American folk dance that's somewhat like the predecessor of tango. This piece is the final work in the collection of 24 South American pieces left by Argentine guitarist and composer Cardoso. Two guitars exchange South American rhythms while varying lyrical and mysterious melodies, creating an addictive piece where the main theme repeats endlessly in your head.

Personally, I love this kind of groove-filled duet piece, but I'd never had the courage to put it on a concert program. Since it was the most memorable piece when I played with Yejin at a previous recital, I've always wanted to perform it together as a couple at a concert someday. That honey-dripping, crystalline melody. 蜜(mil), 瓏(long), 歌(ga).

## Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) - Pavane pour une infante défunte

Ravel, the representative composer of French impressionist music, published this piano piece at age 24 while studying at the Paris Conservatory, setting enchanting melodies and harmonies to the slow dance form of pavane, and from then on became widely known to the public. Later, Ravel himself arranged it for orchestra, making the piece even more famous, and recently it's often performed as jazz, but I think the guitar arrangement version suits this piece best.

This is a piece that Miryeon particularly loves, and we've often put it on stage as a trio with the team leader's arrangement, but this is the first duet since the Hwahyeon Society regular concert in 1997. There's a story that Ravel, who suffered brain damage in a traffic accident in his later years, heard this piece on the radio and exclaimed, "Whose piece is so beautiful?" We'll perform this with the arrangement by the late Hong Seonggak sunbae-nim, which beautifully brings out the original's attractive harmonies and melodies in a guitaristic way. Harmonies majestic but not heavy, melodies sad but not pitiful. (Please listen to it that way!)

## Fernando Sor (1778-1839) - Introduction and Variations on a Theme by Mozart, Op.9

This most famous work by Sor is known to be based on the aria "O Cara Armonia" that appears at the end of Act I of Mozart's opera "The Magic Flute," lasting about a minute. However, in my personal opinion, this level of connection would be more like a tribute composition dedicated to Mozart - with copyright entirely belonging to Sor - rather than a revival or featuring in modern copyright terms.

The structure of the piece feels like: 'Introduction that makes you excited about what's coming - light and bouncy theme - 1st variation jumping around with excitement - 2nd variation pretending to be serious - 3rd variation lost in reverie - 4th variation periodically convulsing and breaking out of its shell - 5th variation coming out and running around wildly with excitement - coda finally looking around and organizing thoughts, promising to live well.' The difference from other variation pieces is that instead of predictably having this kind of variation next, then that kind, each variation creates a story.

Even when I had abundant hand strength in my twenties, I found it somehow difficult and never put it on a concert program. This time, I started with the determination to re-strengthen my fundamentals, but... it's still difficult. However, it's so much fun to gradually incorporate my own interpretation and expression of the piece.

## Anon. / Francis Cutting (c.1550-1596) - Greensleeves

When we think of "Guitar & Voice," it's easy to think of the guitar as simply providing accompaniment. However, in Renaissance lute songs [or airs], the instrument and voice relate to each other as equals. The guitar part of "Greensleeves" that we're performing is an arrangement by 16th-century English lutenist and composer Francis Cutting, which is a vibrant, genuine solo piece. You can think of it as the voice being laid over the guitar.

"Greensleeves" is a very well-known English folk song. Between the repeating refrains are countless verses, and their content is truly monotonous. Not just Greensleeves - the lyrics of Renaissance lute songs are all surprisingly identical. Resenting the heartless woman who abandoned them, yet saying "I still love you," pleading for her to return. Modern people might find it hard to empathize with the sentiment of these lyrics, but the melodies from 500 years ago still touch our heartstrings. Let's immerse ourselves in the sorrow of love following the guitar's melody, at least for today.

## Franz Schubert (1797-1828) - 《Winterreise》 Op.89 · D911, 1. Gute Nacht

"Winterreise" (Winter Journey) is a song cycle by Schubert set to poems by Wilhelm Müller. The content tells of wandering aimlessly in the middle of winter after a broken heart, expressing the wounds of love. Originally composed for tenor, it's often sung by baritone or bass in lower transpositions. As it represents the feelings of a European man in the Romantic era, it's rarely sung by women, but well, love transcends East and West, age, and gender.

Among the 24 songs in "Winterreise," the 5th song "Der Lindenbaum" is famous, but the 1st song, which announces the beginning of wandering with "As a stranger I came, as a stranger I depart again...", is the most poignantly beautiful. We were hesitant about singing in German and tried Korean lyrics, but the team members objected, saying the content was too pathetic and looked bad (though that's what the original content is like!), so we ended up singing in the original language. In art songs (Lieder), the delicate piano accompaniment is as important as the singing, and classical guitar is equally suitable as a partner for Lieder. We use Klaus Jäckle's guitar arrangement and perform in the original key of D minor.

## Heitor Villa-Lobos (1887-1959) - Bachianas Brasileiras No.5, 1. Aria (Cantilena)

Brazil's national composer Villa-Lobos is also special in the guitar world. "Everyone has at least one Villa-Lobos piece in their heart." For me, that's this piece. Bachianas Brasileiras No.5 was composed for eight cellos and soprano, and among the two movements, the 1st movement Aria is famous. Villa-Lobos himself arranged this aria for guitar solo and soprano. A melancholic melody is laid over delicate and beautiful guitar performance. Like the sirens' song, you can't help but be captivated the moment you hear it. However, you need to sing well...

I didn't dare to put this piece on stage. My breathing wasn't good enough, and most importantly, I didn't have the ability to properly produce high B♭. Even while preparing for the concert at Yejin's suggestion, I was conflicted. "Can't we leave this piece out?" "We're doing this duet because of this piece!" This piece was also Yejin's Villa-Lobos in her heart... By the way, the lyrics express the deep 'saudade' (longing/yearning) felt at the moment the moon rises. For our saudade!

## Al Di Meola (1954-) - The Grande Passion

Fusion and Latin jazz guitarist and composer Al Di Meola is a name that even classical guitar enthusiasts might have heard of, thanks to his distinctive Latin-Mediterranean rhythmic composition style, unique performance technique, and collaborations with various musicians. "The Grande Passion" is the centerpiece of his 2000 album, originally a large-scale piece for guitar and orchestra concerto. We present it as a small attempt to broaden Miryeon's performance horizons.

'Passion' usually means enthusiasm, but surprisingly, its Latin etymology means suffering or ordeal. 'Grande Passion' is also 'great suffering.' Both the mysterious original piece and the duet version by Al Di Meola and Barrueco that we present here leave a mysterious and complex impression rather than revealing burning passion, as much as the title's meaning suggests.

## Manuel de Falla (1876–1946) - Spanish Dance No.1 from 《La Vida Breve》

Even if you haven't seen the opera "La Vida Breve," anyone who has been exposed to classical guitar to some extent has surely heard this Spanish dance. It's an interlude from the transition in Act 2 of the opera, characterized by strong flamenco rhythms and folk melodies. It starts as a fast dance in 3/8 time, passes through a section marked pesante, ma con fuoco (heavy, but with fire), and concludes with the earlier theme again. It's a short piece of about 3 minutes and 30 seconds that ends quickly after something different appears, but for a fleeting life that comes and goes once, there's no need to rush through the performance, is there? :)

## Isaac Albéniz (1860-1909) - Castilla (Seguidillas) from 《Suite Española》 Op.47

Albéniz was a pianist and composer from Catalonia, Spain in the late 19th century. He didn't write guitar pieces specifically, but there are many famous guitar works based on his compositions.

Castilla is a place name still used today because the vast central region of Spain around Madrid was the Kingdom of Castilla 800 years ago. If you think of it as the place where Don Quixote rode his horse, it seems perfect. The feeling of a small pony prancing around rather than a large racehorse, and the dazzling feeling of sunlight spreads throughout the piece. There's something uniquely Spanish and earthy about this piece. I thought it might express the atmosphere of Albéniz's hometown, but it turns out his hometown is near Barcelona...

## Antonín Dvořák (1841-1904) - Symphony No.9 in E minor "From the New World" Op.95, IV. Finale: Allegro con fuoco

"From the New World" is probably the most famous work among those Dvořák left during his three years in America. The 4th movement in particular has a very impressive powerful theme reminiscent of 'Jaws.' As everyone knows, the 'New World' refers to America. When Dvořák took the position of director of the National Conservatory of Music in America, he was given the mission of becoming a cornerstone for 'establishing American music,' and he focused on embodying the ethnic characteristics of African Americans and Native Americans in symphonic form. The intense and majestic vigor felt in this piece, the raw vitality, and the melancholy hidden between them... these impressions must have been what the composer felt was American. That's what America was like 100 years ago, apparently.

While this powerful piece is undoubtedly good music, there were many different opinions about whether it's suitable for guitar performance. We hope that our performance, struggling to express the characteristics of orchestral music through various guitar effects, can convey even a fraction of the original's intensity.
