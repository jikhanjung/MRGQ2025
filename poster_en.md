Artist Cho Yuran, who has watched over Miryeon throughout her life, created this work **<The Unseen Sees>** for 《Miryeon 2025》.

A blue tiger leaping from the guitar's sound hole, a giant blue eye looking down upon it - while the tiger is a figure of fear, the unidentified gaze without face or body is an even greater terror that overwhelms the tiger. This work expresses the tension and overwhelming emotions flowing between the two, interpreting the impressions of 《Miryeon 2025》's performance pieces through the artist's visual language.

From Miryeon's perspective, this carries the very realistic meaning: *"The sound from my guitar is fear, the unknown audience is even more overwhelming fear."* On the other hand, perhaps the existence of the unknown audience, the fact that 'the unseen sees,' is what shapes the tiger. If only such a handsome blue tiger could emerge from our guitars!
