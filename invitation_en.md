# Invitation

Greetings to all our dear audience members.

August has arrived, and we are excited to meet you again with the 2025 concert. It seems like just yesterday that we had our 2020 concert, but now it's been 5 years. During this time, Miryeon has continued to practice steadily, and we are delighted to share with you the fruits of our musical journey.

The establishment of our state-of-the-art sheet music system is also significant news from recent times. Thanks to Miryeon's tech team, we have graduated from paper sheet music and concert pieces. While many performers already use tablet + page turner systems, it's not easy to find a system where you can see two pages of sheet music comfortably at a glance and where all performers' page turns are synchronized. We're proud to present the development of Miryeon's dedicated sheet music viewer application that made this possible. Now we really just need to play the guitar well.

Five years ago at our concert, I declared "This is Miryeon's new beginning," and indeed, Miryeon has become new during this time. We've learned to live a life preparing for concerts, shall we say? We've gained the wisdom of planning concerts from at least 2 years in advance, practicing in concert formation for more than a year and a half, and balancing work-life, or rather guitar-life balance. In selecting concert pieces, we've also learned to consider not just our own desires but also the audience. We've put down burdens and grown to love the guitar a bit more, and we've resolved that we can continue living this way.

As you know, Miryeon (未練) means incomplete training or lingering attachment. We will leave some miryeon from this concert and return having grown a little more. We sincerely thank all our audience members who always complete our insufficient concerts.
