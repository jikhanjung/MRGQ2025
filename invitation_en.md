# Invitation

Five years have passed since Miryeon's 20th anniversary concert, which was held amid the sudden onset of COVID-19. Rereading the invitation from *Miryeon2020*, where we reflected on Miryeon's 20 years and pledged a new beginning, I sense a certain solemnity in those words. Now we look back on the past five years once again. During this time, Miryeon members have experienced farewells to grandparents and parents, sent children off to university, started farming, and... are still playing guitar. Though when we get up from our chairs after practice, we all involuntarily let out "Ugh, my back~" sounds.

**The top news from the past five years is undoubtedly "Jinho is back!"**

'Miryeon' is a classical guitar ensemble formed by alumni of Seoul National University's classical guitar club Hwahyeon (和絃會). Originally formed in 2000 as a quartet with Jeon Yewan, Yang Jinho, Cho Eunseok, and Oh Yejin, Kim Hajin joined in place of Yang Jinho from 2003 onward. Yang Jinho's surprise appearance in *Miryeon2020* signaled his return after more than 20 years, and his remarkable ability to quickly recover his former skills proved that "class is eternal." In this *Miryeon2025*, he participates in solo, duet, and quintet pieces, officially announcing his return as a full member of Miryeon.

**The establishment of our state-of-the-art sheet music system is also significant news from recent times.**

Thanks to Miryeon's tech team, we have graduated from paper sheet music and concert pieces. While many performers already use tablet + page turner systems, it's not easy to find a system where you can see two pages of sheet music comfortably at a glance and where all performers' page turns are synchronized. We're proud to present the development of Miryeon's dedicated sheet music viewer application that made this possible. Now we really just need to play the guitar well.

Five years ago at our concert, I declared "This is Miryeon's new beginning," and indeed, Miryeon has become new during this time. We've learned to live a life preparing for concerts, shall we say? We've gained the wisdom of planning concerts from at least 2 years in advance, practicing in concert formation for more than a year and a half, and balancing work-life—or rather, guitar-life balance. In selecting concert pieces, we've also learned to consider not just our own desires but also the audience. We've put down burdens and grown to love the guitar a bit more, and we've resolved that we can continue living this way.

As you know, Miryeon (未練) means incomplete training or lingering attachment. We will leave some miryeon from this concert and return having grown a little more. We sincerely thank all our audience members who always complete our insufficient concerts.
